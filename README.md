This is my submission for assignment eleven: Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers. We were tasked with creating a compatibility-based "Friend Finder" application. This full-stack site takes in results from a user survey and then compares their answers with those from other users; finding a companion that matches their profile (in my case, a musician). In order to accomplish this, I had to utilize my understanding of express npm, Node.js, jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and REST API.
